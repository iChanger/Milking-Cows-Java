# Milking-Cows-Java
Here is a very simple approach, but not the most efficient approach. The best approach is to use an Object-Oriented Array containing start + end times. Then, the start time index is sorted, and then merged with overlapping arrays, which is then tested using quick comparisons using Math.max and Math.min (which I did not use, and I had recently learned about).
